        <p class="section-text" data-scroll>
          Vienna, the capital of Austria, stands as a testament to centuries of
          art, music, and culture. From the grandeur of the Habsburg Empire to
          the birthplace of classical music, Vienna has always been a city that
          moves to its own rhythm—a rhythm that finds its perfect expression in
          the waltz.

          <p class="dance-description">
            The Viennese waltz, with its smooth, continuous 3/4 rhythm, is more
            than a historic ballroom tradition—it’s a reflection of us. Its
            elegance lies in the way two partners move in effortless harmony,
            anticipating each other’s steps, supporting each other’s turns, and
            gliding through space as one. In its flowing motion and perfect
            synchronization, I see the way we navigate life together: balanced,
            connected, and always in tune, no matter how fast the world spins
            around us.

            <h3>City Exploration</h3>
            <p>
              Together, we’ll wander through Vienna like characters in our own
              timeless story—hand in hand along the grand boulevards, slipping
              into quiet courtyards, and lingering in cafés where the scent of
              coffee and warm pastries fills the air. We’ll explore museums that
              hold centuries of art and history, discover hidden streets that
              feel untouched by time, and let the city’s music guide us from one
              beautiful moment to the next. Whether we’re tasting traditional
              dishes, strolling through palace gardens, or simply watching the
              city move around us, Vienna will unfold for us piece by piece—an
              experience rich, magical, and entirely ours to enjoy.

            <h3>Giselle</h3>
            <p>
              At the Vienna State Opera, Giselle unfolds like a whispered legend
              brought to life—haunting, romantic, and steeped in the full magic
              of Romantic ballet. Beneath the soft glow of the stage, the story
              drifts between the warmth of a sunlit village and the moonlit
              realm of the Wilis, where love, betrayal, and forgiveness blend
              into something otherworldly. The dancers move with ethereal
              precision, their bright costumes shimmering against muted,
              dreamlike sets, each motion carrying the emotional weight of a
              tale where passion transcends life itself. As the orchestra
              breathes life into Adam’s timeless score, the audience is swept
              into Giselle’s world—captivated by her innocence, shaken by her
              heartbreak, and ultimately moved by a love strong enough to defy
              even death. It’s an experience that lingers long after the curtain
              falls, a piece of Vienna’s artistic soul shared in one
              unforgettable night.

            <h3>And then there's... us.</h3>
            <p>
              And then there’s the gentle coziness of simply being together
              again—unhurried, unburdened, and wrapped in the comforts Vienna
              seems to offer at every corner. We’ll slip into warm, wood-paneled
              cafés where time slows down, savoring rich pastries, velvety
              coffees, and long conversations that feel like home. Dinner will
              become its own little ritual: candlelit tables, comfortingly
              hearty dishes, and that quiet feeling of closeness that comes when
              the world outside fades for a while. Whether we’re sharing a slice
              of cake, lingering over a glass of wine, or just enjoying the calm
              of being side by side, this trip gives us something rare—space to
              breathe, reconnect, and rediscover the ease and warmth of simply
              being “us” again.
